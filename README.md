The badge: `Checks #âœ“#x(#)` where `x` is the number of successful builds, `y` is the number of failures + errors (if any) and `z` is the number of pendings.

## Settings

You are also recommended to provide your own [github api token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) to allow more frequent refreshes and access to your private repos. Simply run `Preference: GitHub Checks` and edit the `token` setting.
